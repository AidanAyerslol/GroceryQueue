This is the first Project of Jonathan Southard's CMIS 202 class at Frederick Community College.
The project began on February 19th 2025.
Collaborators include Aidan Ayers, Ayush Regmi, Caleb Orchard, and Sameer Soparkar.

The project consists of a simulation holding a network of single server queues. These servers simulate cashiers in a grocery store handling customers in a line.
Service time is determined using normal distribution, and arrival time for customers is determined using exponential distribution and the Poisson Process. 
The project assumes that 2 employees collaborating on one register halves the service time during each transaction in order to make a statement on the efficiency of having 1 open register with a bagger as opposed to 2 open registers with only cashiers. 
Parameters including lambda, mean, and variance used for random distribution are configurable. As well as variables like the number of employees simulated through queues.
Throughput and average passage time for customers are recorded and output.
